  ## Description

  
   I wanted to be able to build an application using OOP to be able to use prompts in command line for a user to input information for a manager and team to be able to generate a organized landing page for display. It will help cutting down time to create the actual html page and styling for the page and only requires the information of team to generate information on html page for use and reference. I used classes and extended classes to help write the code for this project which helped simplifying the syntax for the use of the application. I also used testing of project to ensure application would have a higher chance of running successfully.

  ## Installation
  

  1) Create repository and clone into my local machine. 2) created all necessary folders and files needed in project such as Assets, lib, src, test folders to hold all needed code for the application. 3) I then ran in the command lin in terminal npm init to create package.json and lock-package.json files. 4) then ran npm install inquirer jest and installed both inquirer and jest modules at the same time. 5) Lastly I added all necessary files in each folder and wrote the code for functionality of application.
  



  ## Usage
  

  1) you will need to install all necessary packages and dependencies by running npm i -y then npm install inquirer jest. 3) after all that is installed go to the directory containing the index.js folder then run command node index.js to run application. 4) Answer all prompts and when finished you will get your generated HTML page!
